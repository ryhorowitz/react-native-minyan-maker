# Minyan Maker Mobile App

## Description

This full stack app allows the user to RSVP for the upcoming minyans (synagogue services) in Center City Philadelphia. Minyan Maker sends out scheduled emails to the Synagouge's Rabbi or contact person 1 hour before the service letting them know how many people RSVP'd. This app also has email functionality so the user may message the synagouge to ask questions.

## Real World Need

Some synagouges in Philadelphia will not hold services unless they know that 10 people will show up. This app allows Rabbi's to know in advance if they should cancel services.

## Install
This app uses a React Native frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.
Coming soon. App still in inital developement.
